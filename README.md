# CSA Final Project: Chess

A weak attempt at learning Java and algorithms surrounding video games and 2D datasets. And "AI" i guess.

## Dependencies

- json.simple (soon to be deprecated)

## Installation

Don't. But if you wan't to, you'll need to add the json.simple library into your IDE's referenced library. The website looks sketch but I assure you it is completely fine.
